A economic-distance-based stochastic discount factor estimator for non-traded cash flows

- replace spatial in title
	-more emphasis on economic-distance?

- replace semiparametric model by incompletely specified model?
	- ML also M-estimator!
	- SDF is parameterized, cash flows (= data generating process) is not specified
	- CF and NAV are generated by an unknown - or better unspecified - stochastic process.
	- We will assume certain properties for functions of the data generating process (CF and NAV), specifically for our weighted average error term

- exploding alpha issues may lead to inconsistency of Driessen estimator, does compactness requirement help?

- sub-bootstrap related methods provide out-of-bag error analysis

- positive distance minimum also between fund from same vintage

- Our approach is also applicable to deal level cash flows! Is it necessary there?

- "Asset pricing models should hold for all assets, whether these assets are individual stocks or whether the assets are portfolios." REALLY???
	- tailored SDFs for option cash flows? Can all options on the market index be priced by a beta factor of one?
	- GENERALLY: Can the true SDF price all cash flows?
